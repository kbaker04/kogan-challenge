# Kogan Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Solution

My solution for the Kogan Coding Challenge is a simple React Application that connects to an API to obtain a list of products.

Any products in the Air Conditioning Category are identified and a cubic weight calculated.

This application demonstrates ECMAScript, hooks, functional components, react router and axios to create a simple but efficient SPA to display products.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the node modules

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
